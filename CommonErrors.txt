Common errors:

Not likely a datetime?
errors='coerce' argument in pd.Period() or pd.to_date...
If you are using month as a slice when you get this error, make sure that your input is a list. 

('len',) when running Impact pivot?
Your pivot table is empty, usually because a slice is not being called correctly

unsupported operation between str and int?
Either delete strings in data, or convert numerics to strings

KeyError: column?
Can't find column in data, it may have been removed in an earlier step

ValueError:Cannot set a frame with no defined index and a value that cannot be converted to a Series?
Happened when I thought I was working with App data but then it turned out to be Suite data.
Means a previous filter didn't have the intended effect.
